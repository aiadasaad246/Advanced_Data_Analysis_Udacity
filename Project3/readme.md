# Students Performance 
## by Aiad Asaad


## Dataset
## This is a proect from a complete nanodegree via Udacity


> This data set consists of the marks secured by the students in various subjects.
> There are 1000 students information in the dataset with 8 features (gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, math score, reading score, writing score). only math score,reading score and writing score variables are numeric in nature, but the variables gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test preparation course are ordered factor variables with the following levels.
gender: ["female","male"],
race/ethnicity: ['group A', 'group B', 'group C', 'group D'],
parental level of education: ["bachelor's degree", 'some college', "master's degree", "associate's degree", "high school"],
lunch: ["standard","free/reduced"],
test preparation course: ["none","completed"]


## Summary of Findings

> There were not any unusual points. I think the data are ok and we need not to do any transformations.
We just needed to convert some data to categoral.

> The data arw well-distribuded as we can see from the figures.
> There were some data with object type, so I converted them to categoral.
> The mean of the males at math more than the female.
> Most students have not completed the preperation test

## Key Insights for Presentation

> I noticed that the pereformence of the students is related to parental education, gender and test preperation
All the students who completed the test and there parents has master or bachelor degree pereform well specially in math test

> I think we can use machine learning to predect the student pereformance as the features parental education, gender and test preperation can give us a usefull information about the pereformance of the students
